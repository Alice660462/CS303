# CS303
I created a text file  called ' input.txt.txt ' which has 100 itegers, 10 rows, 10 columns.
read the file into an array.
use the program I wrote to modify the array.
I hard coded my program, so that you can just run my program, and it will show the current array after using each function.
on line 34 and line 50, just remove // to test the exception handlding for adding_number function and modify fucntion.
